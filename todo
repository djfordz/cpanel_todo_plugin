Get the plugin icon and menu item working.
Reorganize commits to only have relevent commits in the branch:
   Squash all the underlying infrastructure so there is a sinlge
   commit for it a list of Step #: and Extra #: commits for the
   lessons.
Put togather the slides from the outline.
Create a branch with localization demo.

Long Term:

Figure out how to get this into Webmail and WHM.
Figure out how to get this to integrate with feature management.
