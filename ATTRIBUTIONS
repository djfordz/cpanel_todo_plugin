Some of the code for this example was developed
off the clock by me: Thomas Green.  While I am
a cPanel, Inc. employee, I also love to code on my
own. My bosses were gracious enough to allow me
to attack my name to this project.

All my work included in this project is covered
under the same license as indicated for the project
as a whole.
